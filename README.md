Design patterns for The Gaming Room Project
The Gaming Room, our client, required a scalable, web-based game application named “Draw It or Lose It” that could operate across multiple operating systems. In developing the documentation, I excelled at clearly articulating the application’s requirements and recommending the optimal development approach. The design document process proved invaluable for maintaining focus and prioritizing tasks, thereby streamlining the coding phase. If I were to revise one aspect, it would be the evaluation chart, to provide a more comprehensive analysis of each operating platform. I interpreted the user’s needs by leveraging personal and peer gaming experiences, ensuring the game was both intuitive and engaging. Considering user needs is crucial as it directly impacts user satisfaction and product success. My approach to software design involved meticulous documentation and modularizing game functionality for easier updates. In the future, I would further study market trends to better understand user preferences and enhance the design process.
